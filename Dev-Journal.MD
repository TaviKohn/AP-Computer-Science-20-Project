                    I have created the framework for my array visualization project. I have successfully been able to display tabs but I haven't managed to get the drop down menus displayed. Data will be stored in multidimensional ArrayLists for easier editing through the gui. Once all the GUI components are implemented, I will have to figure out how to get events through the controlP5 library. Then, I can build the graphical representations of the arrays and tweak the GUI to look better.  I want the final result to be user/programmer friendly and generally intuitive. I may also edit the peasyCam library for less drifting after rotating and may add movement within 3D space.
