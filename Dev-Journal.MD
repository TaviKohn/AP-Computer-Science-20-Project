7:34 AM Tuesday, February 3, 2015: Created Dev Journal
1:00 PM Friday, February 6, 2015: Modified Dev Journal to follow correct format:
                    I have created the framework for my array visualization project. I have successfully been able to display tabs but I haven't managed to get the drop down menus displayed. Data will be stored in multidimensional ArrayLists for easier editing through the gui. Once all the GUI components are implemented, I will have to figure out how to get events through the controlP5 library. Then, I can build the graphical representations of the arrays and tweak the GUI to look better.  I want the final result to be user/programmer friendly and generally intuitive. I may also edit the peasyCam library for less drifting after rotating and may add movement within 3D space.
1:05 PM Friday, February 13, 2015: Added Second Weekly Entry
                    The project is currently behind schedual. I have attempted to move my gui into a seperate file but I now have a NullPointerException which I haven't been able to resolve yet. Hopefully over the weekend I will resolve that and get closer to finishing the gui setup. Then I will be able to progress into the logic of the program.
